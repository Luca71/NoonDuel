How to play:
- As soon as the counter reaches zero you have to shoot down your adversary, but only when the text label on bottom of the screen says "Shoot", otherwise you failed.
- If you shoot down your adversary, you earns one point.
- If you failed two consecutive times in the same match, you lose 1 point.
- The first player that reach 5 points wins the game.
